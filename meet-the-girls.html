    <h3>League: Mnarani</h3>
<p id="paragraph"><I was drawn to the football pitch when I was eight years old. A journey inspired by my brothers  who would allow me to go and watch them play football. I was among the first girls that joined Moving The Goalposts (MTG) in 2002. Watching my brothers play was an agony, because I was allowed to play with the ball when they were done playing. Girls in my community were not allowed to play football or even stay out of the house for long hours. My hope was awakened when I heard of MTG, a sport for development organization that empowers girls and young women in Kilifi.  I never missed football training. My mother was told that I am a good player and when she once came to watch me play, she has never left my side. She is my number one fan.  I was a very shy girl, but drew the attention of men when I was playing. I would feel confident when walking out of the pitch because I believed that my skilled playing would open up the space for more girls to play football. From 200 girls when I joined MTG to over 9,000 in 2017 girls playing football in Kilifi and Kwale Counties. I feel proud because our society now accepts girls to play football, go to school and persue their careers. This was not the case during my mother’s time. She was required to be a home maker, laborer and sometimes they would be forced to get married to older men. I did not want a miserable life and that’s why I practiced the skills I got during MTG weekly reproductive health sessions on decision making and negotiation.</p>

<p>My football career has grown over time. I played for MTG United Team in the National Women’s league and later joined a football club in a neighboring town.  MTG supported me to join University because my parents were not able to help me. I also became one of the players for Kenya Methodist University football team upon joining the university after I got partial scholarship by MTG.  I am currently playing for the Kenya National Football team; Harambee Starlets s and this was because of my outstanding football skills. I have been among the best players for the team that has been participating in national and international tournaments. I was awarded as the top scorer for the 2016 COTIF Women Football Tournament in Valencia, Spain where I scored five goals in four matches during the tournament; I scored three (3) goals in the first match against Benfica Portugal Women which made the Kenya Harambee Starlets win 3-0 against their opponent. We played the second match against Española and won 3- 1 with me scoring two (2) goals for my team! My team also participated in the Africa Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCON) 2016 in Cameroon, the first time ever for the team to reach this level of the completion. I was feted in 2016 as a youth heroin in my County the first ever young woman to receive such credentials. My mother received this award on my behalf because I had travelled to Cameroon for the AWCON.</p>

<p>I firmly believe that gender equality is the key to deliberate women from all forms of oppressions and discrimination. I am an ambassador for Change.</p>
