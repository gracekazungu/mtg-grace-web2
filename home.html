<p id="paragraph">Moving the Goalposts (MTG) is a unique organization that links Gender-Based Violence, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, and economic empowerment within youth sports programming. We use football as our main tool to positively impact the lives of disadvantaged girls and young women between the ages of 9 â€“ 25 in the rural coastal region of Kenya.
Since 2001, we've empowered over 50,000 girls to find their voices and use them to make healthy decisions about their future and fight for lasting change within their community and country. Tunaweza! (We, Can)</p>
