        <h2>Leadership</h2>
        <p>Considering the patriarchal nature of the coastal community, leadership roles either social, economic or political are solely taken by males.</p>

          <p>Our Leadership program is modelled around football as we believe sport has the power to transform and build leaders.</p>
            
          <p> Girls and young women learn by doing. Girls and young women are provided potential space to pursue authority over particular social, economic and political relations.</p>
            
            <h1> HOW WE DO IT</h1>

            <p>“Without the involvement of men and boys in gender equality and elimination of Gender-Based Violence is like a doctor treating symptoms and ignoring the disease."</p>

            <p>In expanding safe spaces for young women and girls in the community, MTG has intensified male engagement and is working actively with young boys and men as allies to influence norms, attitudes and behaviours towards promotion and respect of girls and women’s rights.</p>
                
             <p>This is achieved through sensitization of boys and young men, male parents, local leaders and influential male leaders on gender, positive masculinity, responsible fatherhood and SRHR.</p>
                
              <h1>HOW WE DO IT</h1>
